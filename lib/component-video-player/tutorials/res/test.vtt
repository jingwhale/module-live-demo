00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.190
Hi.

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:01.860
I'm Mo.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.800
And I'm a software engineer
here at 3Play Media.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.420
I'd like to tell you a little
bit about our Caption Format

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.590
Converter.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.980
First of all, 3Play Media is
a captioning and transcription

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:12.900
company.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.010
If you use our service,
you'll have access

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.980
to more than 50 different
caption formats and many tools

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.310
and technologies.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.740
Our Caption Format
Converter is a free tool

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.130
for people who might already
have a captioned file

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.030
but need a different format.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.440
Most video players and platforms
require different caption file

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.660
formats.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.549
With the Caption
Format Converter,

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.940
you can take your SRT
or SBV caption file,

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.840
paste it into the form
below, and select what type

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.190
of caption format
you want to get back.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.800
Below, you'll see a description
of different caption

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.000
and subtitle formats
to help you figure out

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
what you need for your video.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
