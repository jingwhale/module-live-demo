1
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,330
Everyone, please think

2
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,330
of your biggest personal goal.

3
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:23,330
For real -- you can take a second. You've got to feel this to learn it.

4
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,330
Take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal, okay?

5
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,330
Imagine deciding right now

6
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,330
that you're going to do it.

7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,330
Imagine telling someone that you meet today what you're going to do.

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,330
Imagine their congratulations

9
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,330
and their high image of you.

10
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,330
Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud?

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,330
Don't you feel one step closer already,

12
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,330
like it's already becoming part of your identity?

13
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,330
Well, bad news: you should have kept your mouth shut,

14
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,330
because that good feeling

15
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,330
now will make you less likely to do it.

16
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,330
Repeated psychology tests have proven

17
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,330
that telling someone your goal

18
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,330
makes it less likely to happen.

19
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,330
Any time you have a goal,

20
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,330
there are some steps that need to be done, some work that needs to be done

21
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,330
in order to achieve it.

22
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,330
Ideally, you would not be satisfied until you had actually done the work.

23
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,330
But when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it,

24
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,330
psychologists have found that it's called a "social reality."

25
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,330
The mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it's already done.

26
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,330
And then, because you felt that satisfaction,

27
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,330
you're less motivated to do

28
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,330
the actual hard work necessary. (Laughter)

29
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,330
So this goes against the conventional wisdom

30
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,330
that we should tell our friends our goals, right --

31
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,330
so they hold us to it.

32
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,330
So, let's look at the proof.

33
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,330
1926, Kurt Lewin, founder of social psychology,

34
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,330
called this "substitution."

35
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,330
1933, Vera Mahler found,

36
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,330
when it was acknowledged by others, it felt real in the mind.

37
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,330
1982, Peter Gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this

38
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,330
and in 2009,

39
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,330
he did some new tests that were published.

40
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,330
It goes like this:

41
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,330
163 people across four separate tests --

42
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,330
everyone wrote down their personal goal.

43
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,330
Then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room,

44
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,330
and half didn't.

45
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,330
Then everyone was given 45 minutes of work

46
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,330
that would directly lead them towards their goal,

47
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,330
but they were told that they could stop at any time.

48
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,330
Now, those who kept their mouths shut

49
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,330
worked the entire 45 minutes, on average,

50
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,330
and when asked afterwards,

51
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,330
said that they felt that they had a long way to go still to achieve their goal.

52
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,330
But those who had announced it

53
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,330
quit after only 33 minutes, on average,

54
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,330
and when asked afterwards,

55
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,330
said that they felt much closer to achieving their goal.

56
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,330
So, if this is true,

57
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,330
what can we do?

58
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,330
Well, you could resist the temptation

59
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,330
to announce your goal.

60
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,330
You can delay the gratification

61
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,330
that the social acknowledgement brings,

62
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,330
and you can understand that your mind

63
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,330
mistakes the talking for the doing.

64
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,330
But if you do need to talk about something,

65
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,330
you can state it in a way

66
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,330
that gives you no satisfaction,

67
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,330
such as, "I really want to run this marathon,

68
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,330
so I need to train five times a week

69
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,330
and kick my ass if I don't, okay?"

70
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,330
So audience, next time you're tempted to tell someone your goal,

71
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,330
what will you say? (Silence)

72
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,330
Exactly, well done.

73
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,330
(Applause)
